The Festo Gripper
--------


This robot hand was designed by the department of Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences. 
The original parts were designed in solid edge, but I've converted most parts to Solid Works to try to use the solid works URDF export plugin.
