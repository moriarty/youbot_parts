Base Laser Mount
------------

Designed to mount Hokuyo onto the front and read of youbot. 
- The sensor mounts for sale at youbot-store are alu and bend easily, making sensor readings off.
- Printed plastic doesn't bend out of place, if it does get knocked hard, it will break, and it's better the plastic break than the laser scanner. 

The measurements for Hokuyo were found here:

- updated: measurements and cad model of Hokuyo are now in this reporsitory.

- This mount was also designed for a 90 degree usb connection, but a regular connection would also work.
  - With a regular USB connection, the cable sticks out and can be knocked, breaking the USB port on the sensor.
